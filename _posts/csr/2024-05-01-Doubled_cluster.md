title: Cluster specification
---

It seems that the cluster shape can be specified with 5 species.
Each cluster shape species are named as ordinary, long, multi, toothless and opacity. 

## Ordinary shape
![Ordinary_shape]({{site.baseurl}}{%link theme/img/pid/shape/ordinary_shape.png%}){:width="50%"}

First one is ordinary shape.
It has isotropic or semi-isotropic shapes.

## Long shape
![Long_shape]({{site.baseurl}}{%link theme/img/pid/shape/long_shape.png%}){:width="50%"}

## Multi shape
![Multi_shape]({{site.baseurl}}{%link theme/img/pid/shape/multi_shape_double.png%}){:width="50%"}
![Multi_shape]({{site.baseurl}}{%link theme/img/pid/shape/multi_shape_triple.png%}){:width="50%"}

## Toothless shape
![Toothless_shape]({{site.baseurl}}{%link theme/img/pid/shape/toothless_shape.png%}){:width="50%"}

It should be checked. 
But it seems that the configure setting has some problem.
It is possible for strobe and pusle duration to make empty pixel.
